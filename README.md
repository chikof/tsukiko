# Tsukiko

Tsukiko, the [RustðŸ¦€](https://www.rust-lang.org/)-based soundboard that's ready to take on the competition with its unbeatable combination of open source code, user-friendly interface, and powerful features.

With Tsukiko, you'll enjoy the freedom of an open source software that's free for all to use and modify. Its intuitive interface makes it easy to mix and manipulate multiple audio sources, while its customizable hotkeys ensure quick and easy access to frequently used sound effects.

<!-- But that's not all - Tsukiko also boasts a library of preloaded sounds, support for multiple audio sources, and the ability to import/export audio files for seamless integration with other audio software. And with your suggested features such as real-time audio effects, support for external MIDI controllers, and advanced sound editing capabilities, Tsukiko is a soundboard that's truly in a league of its own. -->

> **Warning**
> The sounding board is still under development, so don't expect it to work as you think it will.

> **Note**
> This is a project I'm using to learn Rust, so don't panic if you see bad practices.
